first:
 # ./brinit.sh   # setup prerequisites for bridged network

second:
make sure we have a base image as a VM template (base.qed)

third:
start VM(s) using start.sh:
 $ ./start.sh  # start one vm directly on base.qed
or
 $ ./start.sh <n>  # start <n> VM instances each is a COW copy of base.qed

-> auto-eth0.sh is used in COW guest VMs. It generates ip/hostname for each vm according to its unique macaddr.
-> xuser.sh generate user/password/homedir/ssh-key for a user.
